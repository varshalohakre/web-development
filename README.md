# Full-Stack Web Development Projects

Welcome to my Full-Stack Web Development repository! This repo contains various projects where I have applied my skills in building web applications using modern technologies. Below are the details of the technologies used and a brief overview of the projects.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.
- **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for building the backend.
- **React.js**: For building interactive and dynamic frontend interfaces.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database for storing and managing data.
- **Web3**: To integrate blockchain technology and interact with decentralized applications (DApps).
- **DApps**: Decentralized Applications that interact with blockchain networks for secure and transparent operations.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Full-Stack Web Application with Node.js and React**
- **Description**: A fully functional web application where users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. The app uses **Node.js** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. User authentication and data storage are handled using **PostgreSQL**.
- **Features**:
  - User registration and login with password encryption.
  - Profile management and database interaction with **PostgreSQL**.
  - Dynamic content rendering using **React.js**.
  - Responsive design using **CSS** for an optimal mobile and desktop experience.

### 2. **Blockchain-based Voting System (DApp)**
- **Description**: A decentralized voting system built using **Web3** and **React**. The app allows users to vote on blockchain-based candidates. It ensures transparency, immutability, and decentralization.
- **Features**:
  - Blockchain integration using **Web3.js** to interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
  - Real-time updates on vote counts.
  - Decentralized and secure voting process using blockchain technology.
  - Frontend built with **React.js** to create an interactive user interface.

### 3. **Decentralized Marketplace (DApp)**
- **Description**: A decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell items securely using smart contracts. Built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for backend API management.
- **Features**:
  - Listings for buying and selling goods in a decentralized manner.
  - Payments processed through blockchain using **Web3** and **Ethereum** smart contracts.
  - User authentication and product management.
  - Real-time updates for new products and transactions.

### 4. **CRUD Application with Node.js and PostgreSQL**
- **Description**: A basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application for managing a product catalog. The app uses **Node.js** for server-side logic and **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
- **Features**:
  - Create, update, and delete product items.
  - Listing of products with search functionality.
  - Backend API built using **Node.js** and data stored in **PostgreSQL**.
  - Simple, responsive user interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
